        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Quiz Dangal is an exciting and innovative opinion-based quiz app. Here, instead of traditional 'right or wrong' answers, questions challenge your intuition and predictive skills. We invite you to express your views on current events, social trends, popular culture, or even speculative scenarios.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Our unique gameplay rule ensures that the option that receives the most votes is considered the 'winner'. This transforms every quiz into an intriguing social experiment and a knowledge-based challenge. By analyzing others' opinions, leveraging your insights, and accurately predicting the collective thought, you can pave your way to victory.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
