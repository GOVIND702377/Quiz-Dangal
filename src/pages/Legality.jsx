        'The legal foundation for skill-based gaming in India is primarily established through judicial pronouncements and exceptions within state laws, rather than a single central act specifically legalizing it.',
        'The Public Gambling Act, 1867, a central legislation, generally prohibits gambling across most of India. However, Section 12 of this Act specifically exempts "games of mere skill" from its prohibitions.',
        'The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts have, through landmark judgments, consistently differentiated between "games of skill" and "games of chance." They have repeatedly affirmed that competitions where success depends on a "substantial degree of skill" are not considered gambling.',
        'Key judgments, such as those in State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (1957) and K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996), have reinforced that "games of mere skill" essentially mean games predominantly reliant on skill, even if a minor element of chance exists.',
        'For Quiz Dangal, our format, where the most-voted option wins, requires users to apply analytical abilities and foresight to predict collective thought. This constitutes a significant element of skill, setting it apart from games purely based on luck.'

        'However, it\'s crucial to note that certain states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu, have enacted specific laws prohibiting online gaming for real money. Residents from these states are not permitted to play on the Platform for real cash prizes.',

This deduction will occur either at the time of withdrawal or at the end of the financial year (whichever is earlier). Quiz Dangal will deduct and remit the TDS to the government and provide you with a TDS Certificate (Form 16A).',
