## Deprecated: AI Automation Setup

This document is deprecated. The project now uses a free, non-AI automation pipeline based on RSS/Wikipedia and LibreTranslate.

Please read the new guide instead:

- docs/Automation-Setup.md

Key changes:
- Only non-AI providers are supported (rss/feeds/noai). API key is optional.
- If no provider is configured, the backend falls back to a virtual `rss` provider.
- Schedules and settings remain the same (cadence, live window, cleanup).
